      <description>&lt;p&gt;This crud is called HTML (HyperText Markup Language) and it is basically a very simple programming language instructing your web browser how to draw a page on a screen. Anyone can learn HTML and many people do. The important thing is that no matter what splendid multimedia web pages they might represent, HTML files are just telegrams.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When Ronald Reagan was a radio announcer, he used to call baseball games by reading the terse descriptions that trickled in over the telegraph wire and were printed out on a paper tape. He would sit there, all by himself in a padded room with a microphone, and the paper tape would eke out of the machine and crawl over the palm of his hand printed with cryptic abbreviations. If the count went to three and two, Reagan would describe the scene as he saw it in his mind&amp;rsquo;s eye: &amp;ldquo;The brawny left-hander steps out of the batter&amp;rsquo;s box to wipe the sweat from his brow. The umpire steps forward to sweep the dirt from home plate.&amp;rdquo; and so on. When the cryptogram on the paper tape announced a base hit, he would whack the edge of the table with a pencil, creating a little sound effect, and describe the arc of the ball as if he could actually see it. His listeners, many of whom presumably thought that Reagan was actually at the ballpark watching the game, would reconstruct the scene in their minds according to his descriptions.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
